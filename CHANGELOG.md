## 2025-04-24: Fixed Incarnation Tool Registration

### Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate BaseIncarnation Class**: 
   - Fixed duplicate class definition in polymorphic_adapter.py that was causing conflicts
   - Now properly importing BaseIncarnation from base_incarnation.py

2. **Async/Sync Function Mismatch**:
   - Fixed await calls in non-async functions
   - Schema initialization now delayed until an incarnation is actually used
   - Improved event loop handling during startup

3. **Tool Registration Improvements**:
   - Added explicit tool method listing via `_tool_methods` class attribute 
   - Enhanced automatic tool detection with better inspection logic
   - Fixed direct tool registration that bypasses the tool registry

4. **Dynamic Incarnation Loading**:
   - Improved error handling during incarnation discovery
   - Fixed circular import issues between modules
   - Enhanced logging for better diagnostics

### Implementation Details

- Tool methods can now be explicitly declared in incarnation classes:
  ```python
  class MyIncarnation(BaseIncarnation):
      # Explicitly declare which methods should be registered as tools
      _tool_methods = ['method1', 'method2', 'method3']
  ```

- Fall-back to automatic detection based on:
  1. Return type annotation (List[TextContent])
  2. Being an async method defined in the incarnation class
  3. Having parameters beyond 'self'

- Tools are now directly registered with MCP rather than going through indirect registration

### Verification

- Created verification scripts to confirm incarnation types are correctly defined
- Validated tool method detection logic
- Confirmed schema creation is properly deferred until needed

### Next Steps

1. Install Neo4j Python driver for local testing
2. Add unit tests for the tool registration process
3. Expand verification scripts to test full system integration
