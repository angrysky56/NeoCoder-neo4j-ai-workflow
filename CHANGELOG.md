## 2025-04-26: Fixed Knowledge Graph API Functions (v1.3.0)

### Issues Fixed

1. **Neo4j Node Labeling Integration**:
   - Fixed issue where entities created via `create_entities` weren't properly labeled in Neo4j
   - Implemented proper `:Entity` label for all knowledge graph nodes
   - Added observation labeling with `:Observation` for better querying

2. **Relationship Type Management**:
   - Implemented proper relationship typing with fallback mechanisms
   - Added support for dynamic relationship types with appropriate fallbacks
   - Fixed issues with relationship discovery and traversal

3. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Added fulltext search with proper indexing
   - Implemented relevance-based result ordering
   - Added fallback for environments without fulltext search indexes

### Implementation Details

- Knowledge Graph functions now properly use Neo4j labeling:
  ```cypher
  UNWIND $entities AS entity
  MERGE (e:Entity {name: entity.name})
  ON CREATE SET e.entityType = entity.entityType
  WITH e, entity
  UNWIND entity.observations AS obs
  CREATE (o:Observation {content: obs, timestamp: datetime()})
  CREATE (e)-[:HAS_OBSERVATION]->(o)
  ```

- Added schema initialization with proper indexes and constraints:
  ```cypher
  CREATE CONSTRAINT knowledge_entity_name IF NOT EXISTS 
  FOR (e:Entity) REQUIRE e.name IS UNIQUE

  CREATE INDEX knowledge_entity_type IF NOT EXISTS 
  FOR (e:Entity) ON (e.entityType)

  CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX entity_observation_fulltext IF NOT EXISTS 
  FOR (o:Observation) ON EACH [o.content]
  ```

- Added comprehensive knowledge graph API with 9 specialized functions:
  - `create_entities`: Create multiple entities with observations
  - `create_relations`: Connect entities with typed relationships
  - `add_observations`: Add observations to existing entities
  - `delete_entities`: Remove entities and their connections
  - `delete_observations`: Remove specific observations
  - `delete_relations`: Remove relationships
  - `read_graph`: View the entire graph
  - `search_nodes`: Search for entities
  - `open_nodes`: Get detailed information

### Verification

- Tested entity creation with proper Neo4j labeling
- Verified relationship creation with type properties
- Confirmed fulltext search functionality with fallbacks
- Validated entity deletion with cascading observation removal

### Next Steps

1. Add visualization capabilities for knowledge graph nodes
2. Implement automatic relationship inference
3. Add schema visualization tools
4. Integrate with vector embedding for semantic search

## 2025-04-25: Expanded Incarnation Documentation (v1.2.0)

### Changes

1. **Architectural Documentation**:
   - Added detailed documentation on architectural principles
   - Described common graph schema motifs across incarnations
   - Documented the relationship between different incarnation types

2. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - Added information about quantum-inspired approaches
   - Outlined future integration plans

## 2025-04-24: Fixed Incarnation Tool Registration (v1.1.0)

### Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate BaseIncarnation Class**: 
   - Fixed duplicate class definition in polymorphic_adapter.py that was causing conflicts
   - Now properly importing BaseIncarnation from base_incarnation.py

2. **Async/Sync Function Mismatch**:
   - Fixed await calls in non-async functions
   - Schema initialization now delayed until an incarnation is actually used
   - Improved event loop handling during startup

3. **Tool Registration Improvements**:
   - Added explicit tool method listing via `_tool_methods` class attribute 
   - Enhanced automatic tool detection with better inspection logic
   - Fixed direct tool registration that bypasses the tool registry

4. **Dynamic Incarnation Loading**:
   - Improved error handling during incarnation discovery
   - Fixed circular import issues between modules
   - Enhanced logging for better diagnostics

### Implementation Details

- Tool methods can now be explicitly declared in incarnation classes:
  ```python
  class MyIncarnation(BaseIncarnation):
      # Explicitly declare which methods should be registered as tools
      _tool_methods = ['method1', 'method2', 'method3']
  ```

- Fall-back to automatic detection based on:
  1. Return type annotation (List[TextContent])
  2. Being an async method defined in the incarnation class
  3. Having parameters beyond 'self'

- Tools are now directly registered with MCP rather than going through indirect registration

### Verification

- Created verification scripts to confirm incarnation types are correctly defined
- Validated tool method detection logic
- Confirmed schema creation is properly deferred until needed

### Next Steps

1. Install Neo4j Python driver for local testing
2. Add unit tests for the tool registration process
3. Expand verification scripts to test full system integration
