# Cypher Snippet Tool Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the integration of a Cypher snippet toolkit into the NeoCoder Neo4j AI workflow project. The toolkit provides a searchable collection of Cypher query snippets that can be used as a reference and learning tool.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create New Tool Functions
Add the following new tool functions to the `Neo4jWorkflowServer` class in `server.py`:

- `search_cypher_snippets`: Search for Cypher snippets by keyword, tag, or pattern
- `get_cypher_snippet`: Get a specific Cypher snippet by ID
- `list_cypher_snippets`: List all available Cypher snippets with optional filtering
- `create_cypher_snippet`: Add a new Cypher snippet to the database
- `update_cypher_snippet`: Update an existing Cypher snippet
- `delete_cypher_snippet`: Delete a Cypher snippet from the database

### 2. Update Server Initialization
Update the `_register_tools` method to include the new tools.

### 3. Update Tool Descriptions
Update the `get_tool_descriptions` method to include descriptions for the new tools.

### 4. Integrate into Guidance System
Update the guidance hub to include information about the Cypher snippet toolkit.

## Data Model Extensions
The existing Cypher toolkit has already set up the following data model:

- `:CypherSnippet` nodes with properties:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Display name
  - `syntax`: The Cypher syntax pattern
  - `description`: Description of what the snippet does
  - `example`: An example usage of the syntax
  - `since`: Neo4j version since the syntax is supported
  - `tags`: Array of tags for categorization

- `:Tag` nodes with property:
  - `name`: Tag name

- `:TAGGED_AS` relationships between `:CypherSnippet` and `:Tag`

## Testing Plan
1. Test each tool function individually
2. Verify integration with the existing Neo4j database
3. Test search functionality with various queries
4. Verify that snippet management works correctly

## Documentation
Update the README.md to include information about the new Cypher snippet toolkit.
