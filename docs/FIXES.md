# NeoCoder-Neo4j-AI-Workflow - Import Error Fixes

## Issue Summary

The project was experiencing import errors related to the incarnation system:

```
Error loading incarnation module data_analysis_incarnation: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'value'
Error loading incarnation module decision_incarnation: type object 'IncarnationType' has no attribute 'DECISION'
Error loading incarnation module research_incarnation: type object 'IncarnationType' has no attribute 'RESEARCH'
ImportError: cannot import name 'ResearchOrchestration' from 'mcp_neocoder.incarnations.research_incarnation'
```

The root cause was a circular dependency in how incarnation types and classes were defined and loaded.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Initialization Sequence Problem**: The module initialization sequence was causing circular dependencies that resulted in uninitialized enum values.

2. **Missing Implementation**: The `ResearchOrchestration` class was missing from the `research_incarnation.py` file, causing the import error.

3. **Incomplete Class Initialization**: Some incarnation classes weren't properly calling their parent class initializers.

## Solution Details

### Fixed Initialization Order

1. Modified `__init__.py` to first import the bare minimum (`IncarnationType`, `BaseIncarnation`), then extend incarnation types, and only then try to import incarnation classes. This breaks the circular dependency.

2. Added explicit try/except blocks around incarnation imports in `__init__.py` to handle potential import errors gracefully.

3. Updated server.py to import IncarnationType from base_incarnation without redundant imports.

### Implemented Missing Classes 

1. Created a complete implementation of the `ResearchOrchestration` class in `research_incarnation.py`.

### Fixed Class Initializers

1. Updated `DecisionSupport.__init__` to call its parent initializer (`super().__init__`) to ensure proper tool registration.

### Enhanced Error Handling

1. Added proper error handling around incarnation imports to avoid breaking the server when an incarnation module cannot be loaded.

## Architectural Notes

The system uses a dynamic discovery mechanism for incarnations, with the following components working together:

1. **base_incarnation.py**: Defines the base `IncarnationType` enum and `BaseIncarnation` class
2. **incarnation_registry.py**: Discovers incarnation modules and extends the `IncarnationType` enum
3. **Incarnation modules**: Define specific incarnation classes inheriting from `BaseIncarnation`
4. **server.py**: Uses incarnation registry to load and switch between incarnations

The initialization sequence is critical - the base types must be defined, then extended, and only then can modules depending on specific enum values be imported.

## Testing

After these changes, the server should be able to start successfully and all incarnation types should be available for use via the `switch_incarnation` tool.
