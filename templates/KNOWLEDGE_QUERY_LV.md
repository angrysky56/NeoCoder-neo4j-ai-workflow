# LV-Enhanced Knowledge Query (Refined Output Architecture)

**Keyword:** `KNOWLEDGE_QUERY_LV`
**Version:** 2.0

## Description

Query knowledge using multi-perspective LV-guided search with emphasis on substantive analytical output rather than process metrics.

## Steps

1. **Silent Entropy Assessment**: entropy = estimate_prompt_entropy(query) [Internal: No output]
2. **Transparent Enhancement Decision**: Apply LV if entropy > 0.4 [Internal: Log only]
3. **Initialize LV Infrastructure**: Setup ecosystem dynamics [Internal: No user-facing metrics]
4. **Execute Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Generate diverse analytical vectors
5. **Synthesize Substantive Results**: Focus on knowledge insights, not ecosystem metrics
6. **Present Analytical Content**: Lead with insights, relegate process details to footnotes
7. **Validate Knowledge Quality**: Ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness [Internal verification]
8. **Record Infrastructure Metrics**: Log LV performance data [Internal: Database only]
9. **Deliver Cognitive Products**: Present analysis as primary content

## Output Structure

### Primary Content (90% of response):
- **Substantive Knowledge Analysis**: Deep insights, connections, implications
- **Multi-Perspective Synthesis**: Different analytical approaches and their conclusions
- **Emergent Patterns**: Novel connections and higher-order insights
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Practical applications and next steps

### Infrastructure Acknowledgment (10% of response):
- Brief footer noting diversity preservation methodology
- Optional technical details in collapsible sections
- LV metrics available on request only

## Quality Metrics
- **Analytical Depth**: Multi-layered insights demonstrating recursive thinking
- **Perspective Diversity**: Multiple complementary analytical approaches
- **Knowledge Integration**: Synthesis across domains and sources
- **Actionable Value**: Practical utility of generated insights

## Implementation Notes
- LV ecosystem dynamics operate as invisible cognitive substrate
- Process metrics relegated to debug/verbose modes
- User experience prioritizes analytical content over algorithmic mechanics
- Diversity preservation mentioned minimally, demonstrated maximally
